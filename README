NAME
    Role::Kerberos - A role for managing Kerberos 5 credentials

VERSION
    Version 0.01_01

SYNOPSIS
      use Moo;
      with 'Role::Kerberos';

      # go nuts

DESCRIPTION
    Authen::Krb5 is kind of unwieldy. Authen::Krb5::Simple is too simple (no
    keytabs). Authen::Krb5::Effortless requires too much effort (can't
    specify keytabs/ccaches outside of environment variables) and
    Authen::Krb5::Easy hasn't been touched in 13 years.

    The purpose of this module is to enable you to strap Kerberos onto an
    existing (Moo[se]) object, as any role is apt to do.
